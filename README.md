# üòÅ Moody

A beautifully designed mobile app that lets users track their moods over the last 7 days and receive quotes based on how they feel. Users can also add personal notes and monitor their sleep and mood patterns through charts ‚Äî helping them better understand and manage their emotional well-being.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- Expo  
- React Native  
- TypeScript  
- Stylesheets for styling  
- Firebase (Authentication + Database)  
- Yup (Schema validation)  
- React Hook Form (Form handling)  
- Zustand (State management)  
- React Query (API management)  
- React Native MMKV (Key-value storage)  
- React Native Keyboard Controller (Keyboard handling)  
- React Native Gifted Charts (Bar charts)  
- Sonner Native (Toasts)  
- React Native Skeleton Kit (Loading placeholders)

## üí° The Idea

I wanted to build something fun to apply what I had been learning in React Native. I stumbled upon the idea of mood tracking and found it both useful and exciting. After some exploration, I discovered a Figma file showcasing a similar concept, which inspired the UI design. I customized the features and visuals and started building from there.

## ‚ú® Features

- Authentication using Firebase  
- Mood tracking for the past 7 days  
- Add personal notes  
- View motivational quotes based on your mood  
- Graphs for mood and sleep tracking  
- Light/dark mode ready (currently defaulting to light mode)  
- Real-time updates using Firebase and React Query

## üß© How It Works

1. After authentication, users are taken to the **Home Screen** where they can view their mood history from the past 7 days.
2. Tapping the add button initiates a flow:
   - **Choose Mood**
   - **Choose Emotions** (select 3)
   - **Choose Reasons** (select 3)
   - **Hours of Sleep**
   - **Add Note**
3. Once completed, the user is redirected to the Home Screen with the updated mood entry displayed.
4. The **Stats Screen** presents two bar charts showing mood and sleep data from the last 7 days.

## üß† What I Learned

- Mobile development differs significantly from web ‚Äî especially in terms of UX expectations, component structures, and styling approaches.
- How to use **Yup** effectively with **React Hook Form** for reusable and maintainable form validations.
- Understood the power of **Zustand** and why it‚Äôs a great alternative to Context API or Redux for simpler and more performant state management.
- Learned how fonts are handled in React Native (a very different process from web).
- Strengthened my knowledge of **TypeScript** within a React Native environment.
- Learned to implement authentication using Firebase and structure user-specific collections.
- Gained experience in writing scalable and modular code, especially with the use of reusable components and hooks.
- Discovered how to query specific ranges (like last 7 days) from Firebase collections.
- Realized the importance of debugging and testing cross-device behaviors in mobile apps.
